        <b>Step 4: Add a Lesetho Address (recommended)</b>
            <p>PayPal is very strict with Nigerian accounts. This means that if a mistake is made, they will lock any money you put in the account or you might end up being unable to receive funds with the account, only able to send. Therefore, it is advisable to create your account using Lesotho. PayPal is safer and more widely accepted there, as well as in other African countries. By doing this, it will appear as if you live and do business in Lesotho.
