            <p>Quite a while back, I wrote an article on How to Subscribe Apple Music in Nigeria with MTN Airtime. However, it has come to my attention that many people are complaining about the MTN USSD code for Apple Music subscription not working for them despite several attempts.</p>
            <p>I cannot definitively state a reason why the MTN USSD code is being selective and working for some but not for others. However, what I can assure you is that I have come up with a solution to fix your MTN USSD code for Apple Music not working once and for all.</p>
